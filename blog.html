                Hello, my name is Anand Kumar and I am a web developer from Ara, Bihar. I have always been
                fascinated by the power of the internet and how it can connect people, businesses, and ideas
                across
                the world. In this blog post, I want to share with you my journey of learning web development
                and some of the skills and tools that I use to create websites.
                Web development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites that run on the
                internet. It involves both front-end and back-end aspects of web creation. Front-end development
                deals with the visual and interactive parts of a website, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
                JavaScript. Back-end development handles the logic and functionality of a website, such as
                databases, servers, and APIs.
                I started learning web development when I was in 10th grade at Vivekanand Public School. I was
                curious about how websites work and how they are made. I enrolled in an online course that
                taught me
                the basics of HTML and CSS. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to define
                the
                structure and content of a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to
                style and format the appearance of a web page.
                After completing the course, I started practicing my skills by creating simple web pages for
                fun. I
                also joined some online communities where I could learn from other web developers and get
                feedback
                on my work. I learned a lot from reading blogs, watching tutorials, and doing projects.
                When I was in 12th grade, I decided to pursue web development as a career. I applied for
                admission
                at Veer Kuwar Singh University where they offered a bachelor's degree in computer science.
                There, I
                learned more advanced topics in web development such as Bootstrap and JavaScript. Bootstrap is a
                framework that helps to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites. JavaScript is a
                programming
                language that adds interactivity and dynamic features to websites.

                During my graduation, I also worked as a freelance web developer for some local clients. I
                created
                websites for small businesses, NGOs, and personal portfolios. I gained valuable experience in
                working with real-world projects and clients. I also improved my communication, problem-solving,
                and
                time-management skills.
                Right now, I have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I am also learning
                some new technologies such as React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. React.js is a library that helps to
                create
                user interfaces for web applications. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows to run
                JavaScript on the server-side. MongoDB is a database system that stores data in JSON-like documents.
                My goal is to become a full-stack web developer who can handle both front-end and back-end
                aspects of web development. I am passionate about creating websites that are user-friendly, functional,
                and beautiful. I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself.
